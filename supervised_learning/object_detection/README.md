# Object Detection

## Description

This project is part of my Holberton School Machine Learning Specialization. I'm truly grateful to be part of this amazing program and to be learning something as incredible and current as this is.

The project itself, is to be a fully working code on `Object Detection`, I'm making this `README.md` previous to starting the project itself, plus I need to read and watch a lot before truly explaining what it entiles.
