# Policy Gradients

### Why Calculate the Gradient?

> In reinforcement learning, we need to update our weights to make better decisions over time.

To do this, we need to know how changing the weights, will change our action probabilities. This is where the gradient comes in. The gradient tells us the direction and rate at which the probabilities change when we adjust the weights.
